# Simple Perceptron from Scratch

A basic implementation of a Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP) using Python and NumPy.

### How it works
* **Input:** 2 binary inputs.
* **Activation:** Step function.
* **Optimization:** adjusting weights and bias based on prediction error.

### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* NumPy

### Usage
Run the script to see the perceptron train over 50 epochs and converge on the correct weights.
